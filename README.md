# autocross

## Motivation
I am a data scientist, engineer, and overall geek out on all things science, robotics, and data. I love race cars--the mechanics of it all, seeing something pushed to unexpected boundaries. I'm devoting this work to exploring the role of data in optimization of racing and race cars. 


## Test and Build

Python 3.7.6
